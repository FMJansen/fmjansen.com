- **Graphic design for Digital Interfaces** Developed two recorded mini lectures for a new bachelor course
- **Designing basic logos** Developed and ran together with [Aman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanadalal/) and [Gabriele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-maria-schieppati/)
- **Visualising your personal identity** Originally created by [Mark](https://markjanssen.design) and [Eva](http://evaoosterlaken.com). I took over and coordinated and ran it in person for 30 students, but also with 250+ students, both offline and online, with up to ten facilitators.
