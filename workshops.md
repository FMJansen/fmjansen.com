# Workshops

Since 2018, I have been giving several workshops at TU Delft on the topics of:

- **Creating a beautiful and readable report** Developed and ran together with several other people
- **Designing basic logos** Developed and ran together with [Aman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanadalal/) and [Gabriele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-maria-schieppati/)
- **Visualising your personal identity** Originally created by [Mark](https://markjanssen.design) and [Eva](http://evaoosterlaken.com). I took over and coordinated and ran it in person for 30 students, but also with 250+ students, both offline and online, with up to ten facilitators.
- **Using Figma in collaborative course work** Created by [Tjapko](https://tjapkovermeulen.com/), I just helped running it
