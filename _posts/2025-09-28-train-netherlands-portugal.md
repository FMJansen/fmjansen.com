## In short

Taking the train from Amsterdam to Porto and back from Lisbon to Amsterdam is a hassle. I thought I’d share my 
itinerary and experience for the next fool who wants to try.

## Context: Choosing the train
Because of plans in Porto, I wanted to travel there. Most people would take the plane – and rightfully so. Taking the 
train to a place like London works well and saves you about [95%](https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/sustainability#Carbon-emissions) of the CO2 emissions, and brings you from the city 
center of Amsterdam straight to London in less time than the flight with security added on. Portugal, on the other hand, 
is not as quick and easy to reach by train. 

There are no direct trains to Portugal, you can’t book the trip at one point of sale, it takes at least two full travel 
days, and it ‘only’ saves about 85% on the journey’s CO2 emissions[^1] because of the longer distance (actually, 
that’s still quite good, isn’t it?). Oh, and it can easily set you back twice the cost of a plane ticket, excluding 
the price to stay the night halfway there. However, I hate sitting in a plane, I do like trains, I had the time and 
I thought the experiment was worth the try.

### The ingenious idea
The idea was quite simple: book a train from Amsterdam to Porto and one (or a few) from Lisbon to Amsterdam (any
station in those three cities).

The Treinreiswinkel, a Dutch train booking service, already has some 
[solid information (in Dutch)](https://support.treinreiswinkel.nl/article/135-treinen-naar-portugal) on how to get from 
Amsterdam to Porto in three days, or Amsterdam to Lisbon in two. Their main advice is to use an Interrail ticket and 
book the seats you need along the way. However, for several trains, there is only a limited amount of seat reservations 
available for Interrail travellers. So I decided to book the journey manually, to ensure I could really take the 
trains I wanted.

### The painful planning
None of the ticket websites (Treinreiswinkel, Bahn.de, NS International, etc.) allows you to book the entire trip. 
Partly because it’s a fool’s errand to even take this journey by train, partly because not all operator trains can be 
booked through each point of sale. 

Additionally, none of the ticket websites can find you the entire trip in a ‘reasonable’ amount of time. Some will 
suggest a three- or four-day trip, and others will say it’s not even possible at all. So you have to plan the trip bit 
by bit, going back and forth to find properly connecting trains. While doing that, you have to check which trains 
will exist but can’t be booked yet (looking at you, Renfe and CP, which only allow you to book some trains 6 
weeks before departure). 

After all that work, you’ve spent about a full working week spread over two months to find the right trains and to book 
the tickets. Great! Now you can make the journey both ways in a weekend, each, for almost €900 (excluding the two 
nights you have to spend in Madrid and Barcelona). You can still decide to fly, of course...

### The reasonable reality
If you’re lucky like me, all the trains run on time (it helps that none of the trains move through the German 
Bermuda Train Triangle, probably). The trains in and out of Portugal aren’t great, though, and I’d advise you to
replace the train from Vigo to Porto with a bus. Otherwise, the schedule below worked! So I’ve listed the exact trains, 
where to book them, and their prices. 

About that price: I often booked the more expensive tickets with the flexibility of cancelling or changing the train,
since I didn’t trust I would make all the connections. I also booked one leg in first class, just to treat myself. 
But that is also a leg with variable pricing, anyway. Regardless, you can definitely make it cheaper than my €900 
for the return trip.

Beneath both tables, I’ve written about my experience booking the tickets, taking the trains, and transferring at 
the stations.

			<summary><strong>Eurocity Direct 9520:</strong> Amsterdam to Bruxelles Midi</summary>
			<p>The first ticket was immediately for a long stretch. Through NS International you can book the EuroCity 
			Direct to Brussels and the connecting TGV to Valence Rhône-Alpes Sud. Nothing special here, really.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>TGV 9826: Bruxelles Midi to Valence TGV</strong></summary>
			<p>Easy transfer, even if Midi isn’t the most beautiful station on earth.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>AVE 9742:</strong> Valence TGV to Barcelona Sants</summary>
			<p>From this train onwards, I could book most of my tickets through Renfe, although often booking trains separately.</p>
			<p>Valence TGV is a fine transfer station (but don’t expect to be able to get a vegetarian lunch) and my 
			connecting train left from the track I arrived at. Nice!</p> 
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>AVLO 6310:</strong> Barcelona Sants to Madrid Puerta Atocha - Almudena Grandes</summary>
			<p>On Spanish high speed trains, apparently you need to go through security. So after arriving at Barcelona, I 
			had to put my bags in a scanner before being able to board the train. This was a quick process and in my case 
			there were no queues, so this was fine.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>AVE 4505:</strong> Madrid Chamartín-Clara Campoamor to Vigo Urzaiz</summary>
			<p>If you make sure to go to the Chamartín station (not Pta. Atocha), this should be fine.</p>
			<p>Chamartín was under construction, but the signage was good. Once again security went quick and the 
			platform was announced with plenty of time to board the train.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>IN 422:</strong> Vigo Guixar to Porto Campanha ⚠️</summary>
			<p class="take-away">You’re probably better off taking a bus, for this part.</p>
			<p>All the tickets until now could be booked at least 2.5 months ahead of time, but I could book this train 
			only 1.5 months before departure.</p>
			<p>Sadly, this was also the first part of the journey which was a bummer. All previous trains were
			wonderful: clean and modern trains with assigned seats and power outlets at each seat. This train, however,
			was an old, local train with none of those facilities. When I took this trip, it also turned out the part 
			from Vigo to the first station across the border would be done by bus. This delayed the trip a bit, too.</p>
			<p>Vigo Urzaiz, where I arrived in the city, is a modern station, located under a shopping mall. Most 
			stores in the mall were closed on Sunday, but the restaurants were open. Vigo Guixar, however, is quite a 
			small station, about a 15-minute walk away if you take the 
			<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(ascensor)">public elevator</a> down a hill. Neither 
			place is worth spending 6 hours, though.</p>
			<p>I tried to avoid long-distance buses because I prefer trains (more comfortable and faster). Here, I 
			should have ignored my train preference, though. Because a Flixbus leaves just outside Urzaiz with 29 
			minutes for the transfer. That would have cut my waiting time drastically, and I would have arrived 
			a full five hours earlier in Porto.</p>
			<p>Lastly, it’s good to remember the arrival times are in the Portuguese timezone, Western European (Summer)
			Time).</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>Alfa Pendular 121:</strong> Lisboa Oriente to Entroncamento</summary>
			<p>A short trip with the high speed train. Lisboa Oriente is easy to reach by metro.</p>
			<p>I could book this and the next train 2 calendar months ahead of time (so the 1st of the month before you’re 
			taking the trip).</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>Raiano 481:</strong> Entroncamento to Badajoz</summary>
			<p>Ooph. At Entroncamento, my CP app said the train would leave from track 2. I hauled myself up the stairs 
			and down the other side of the walk bridge, only to find an empty train. One minute before departure, I 
			heard the announcement that the train to Badajoz from platform 6 would leave soon. So I ran back and... 
			easily caught the train because it was still waiting for a different connecting train. Lucky me.</p>
			<p>A better app and more present information on the platforms would have saved a bit of stress, though.</p>
			<p>The train itself is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_Class_0350">one-carriage diesel powered 
			beast</a> which is far from comfortable for the nearly four hours it takes to get to Badajoz, but it 
			works.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>Reg. Expres 18777:</strong> Badajoz to Puertollano</summary>
			<p>In booking this ticket, I messed something up. I’m not sure why, but I couldn’t manage to get a ticket from 
			Badajoz to Madrid, so I ended up with a ticket from Badajoz to Merida, first. Then, while booking Merida to 
			Madrid, I noticed I would take the exact same train for the part from Merida to Puertollano. When I try to 
			book this journey, now, it <em>is</em> possible to get a ticket from Badajoz straight to Madrid with just one 
			transfer.</p>
			<p>Badajoz station is a small but modern station and there was even a cafe where I could get a cup of coffee.</p>
			<p>The train itself was the emptiest I’d encounter, with only four other people in my carriage. And, while 
			not the modern high speed trains I had gotten used to from Renfe, it was actually still quite new and I did 
			have power outlets.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>Avant 08191:</strong> Puertollano to Madrid Puerta Atocha - Almudena Grandes</summary>
			<p>The transfer at Puertollano was a bit stressful, but smooth. When I got off the train, a staff member of 
			Renfe asked whether I had to make the transfer to Madrid and directed me down the stairs and to the right. 
			There, a security staffer told me I had to go straight, up, and through security (of course! I was getting 
			back on Spanish high speed trains!) After a quick bag check, my ticket was scanned, and I could head back 
			down and to the right platform.</p>
			<p>The train was nice, but it lacked power outlets at the chairs. Nothing too major, but perhaps good to 
			know.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>OGV 06611:</strong> Madrid Puerta Atocha - Almudena Grandes to Barcelona Sants</summary>
			<p>There are a few Renfe trains running from Madrid to Barcelona on Saturday evening, but none properly 
			connected with my previous train. When I did arrive that saturday evening, my train was early and it seemed 
			like perhaps I could have made it, but of course you don’t know that beforehand. Instead, I figured out through 
			some train planners that there was <em>a</em> train which I could make. However, it took a bit of digging to 
			figure out that this OGV train is run by Ouigo (a part of the French SNCF) and can only be booked through 
			<a href="https://www.ouigo.com/en/">their website</a>.</p>
			<p>The transfer was perfect, though, because as I entered the arrivals/departures hall at Madrid, the OGV 
			started boarding. I could just get a sandwich at the shop in the hall, and join the queue to get my ticket 
			checked. It took a few minutes to walk by the 15-something double-decker coaches to get to my seat, but 
			there was more than enough time to do that.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>TGV 9708</strong> Barcelona Sants to Paris Gare de Lyon</summary>
			<p>Booking this day was the easiest part of booking, since Barcelona to Amsterdam can be booked through 
			NS International.</p>
			<p>I started my last travel day by going through security about 45 minutes before departure. There was only 
			a short queue to do so, and I could sit in the waiting area.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary><strong>Eurostar 9369:</strong> Paris Nord to Amsterdam Centraal</summary>
			<p>On the way to Porto, I could evade <em>the transfer</em> in Paris between the two train stations with 
			an RER ride. On the way back home, however, this would be the best option.</p>
			<p>I didn’t like having to take the RER, because it’s a stressful process, but I managed fine. It does
			entail rushing from the train (I was in the carriage furthest back), down to the RER station, checking in 
			with the <a href="https://bonjour-ratp.fr/en">Bonjour RATP</a> and My Navigo Tickets apps, taking the D due 
			North, getting off, and checking out into Hall 5. There, I had to wait for about fifteen minutes until the 
			platform was announced and I could walk from under platform 21 to platform 7. Phew!</p>
			<p>The train consisted of two parts, with one (carriage 8 through 1) going to Brussels, and the part in 
			front (carriage 11 through 18) continuing to Amsterdam. Weird, but fine if you know this!</p>

## Doing it yourself

So lets say you want to try this, too. I’m not sure if I really recommend this, but it worked and I had a reasonably 
good time.

One tip: check out [Seat61](https://www.seat61.com/european-train-travel.htm), I just figured out they have listed a possibly better itinerary from Lisbon to 
Madrid, (although I’m not sure whether it allows you to get to Barcelona on the same day) and refer to Omio for booking 
that entire trip in one go.

Lastly, please do send me a message with any question you might have, or to let me know you did it (and how it went,
you wonderful fool!) Thanks!

## Footnotes

[^1]: When calculating it based on a UK Government data set used by [Our World in
	Data](https://ourworldindata.org/travel-carbon-footprint), it comes down to 10 to 85 kg for the train on the way to
	Porto (there’s a different number for a Eurostar trip, which is probably similar to most of the trains until 
	crossing into Portugal except for the energy mix, and national rail, which is probably similar to the diesel beast 
	from Entroncamento to Badajoz) versus 241 kg for a plane, and 10 to 87 kg for the train back from Lisbon to 
	Amsterdam with 286 kg for a plane.
	
	According to [EcoPassenger](https://ecopassenger.org/bin/query.exe/en?ld=uic-fat&L=vs_uic&protocol=https:&seqnr=2&ident=o9.0211872837.1759049893&OK#focus), 
	the train emits 60 (to) and 51 (from) kg of CO2 equivalents while going by plane emits 337 (to) and 385 (from) kg, 
	as long as you take the extra emissions from planes at high altitudes into account. If you ignore those, the plane 
	emits 151 (to) and 172 (from) kg CO2. 
	
	The very best case scenario means that we’re comparing 20 kg to 527 kg (meaning the train would take only just under 
	4%, but that’s _very_ generous for the train) and the very worst case would be comparing 172 kg to that same 527 kg 
	(33%, from Our World in Data) or 111 kg to 323 kg (34%, from EcoPassenger). The middle scenario would be taking the 
	CO2 values from EcoPassenger including the high altitude emissions from the airplane: 111 kg for the train compared 
	to 722 kg, meaning the train emits about 15% of what an airplane would.
