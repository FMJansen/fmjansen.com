# Firefox button-anchor keyboard trap

Recently, I tested a website for accessibility issues and came across what I thought was a keyboard trap. However, it only showed up in Firefox and I couldn’t figure out what caused it. I wanted to share this for the next person who comes along and gets stumped, but I’ve filed [a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1935639) as well.

## The problem

When a button is also a flex container _and_ lives inside of an anchor, your keyboard focus will start toggling between the anchor and the button in Firefox. [WCAG 2.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap) requires that “focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface”. I thought this button-anchor construction violated that success criterion, but since you can still move focus away by going back (`Shift+Tab`), it doesn’t. Still, it’s not the best of user experiences.

Do note that a button is not allowed in an anchor element according to [the specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-a-element). So, even if this gets solved in Firefox, it’s still not the best idea to nest a button in an anchor.

You can try out the [live example](/keyboard-trap.html) and see the code below.

``` html
<a href="#before">Item before</a>

<a href="#problem">
  <button style="display: flex;">
    Label
  </button>
</a>

<a href="#after">Item after</a>
```

## Update 24th January 2025

I rewrote the text to reflect that it isn’t a real keyboard trap, since you can move your focus back.
