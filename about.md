## In short
I got a bachelor in Industrial Design Engineering and then went on to do a master in Design for Interaction, both at Delft University of Technology.
Overall, my goal is to improve our planetâ€™s well-being, bit by bit. To be more exact, I want to include human well-being and sustainability in every project I work on. Next to that, Iâ€™m interested in themes like household products and furniture; information security, AI and privacy; and branding.

### Resume

This page should give a good feel for who I am, but who can resist a good old resume in PDF format? I know I canâ€™t, so you can download that here:

## Vision on design
For me, design in the narrowest sense revolves around something similar to Dieter Ramsâ€™ ten principles of good design; innovative, clean and sustainable design is something which I strive for. However, this view on its own would be limited, since it revolves mainly around physical product design. While I love well designed physical products, I would like to find other solutions wherever possible; if we donâ€™t need to use physical resources, we shouldnâ€™t.

      <source srcset="/static/img/about/principles.svg">

        data-srcset="/static/img/about/principles.png 1x,
          /static/img/about/principles@2x.png 2x"
        src="/static/img/placeholder.jpg"
      data-src="/static/img/about/principles.png">

      Dieter Ramsâ€™ principles are good, but donâ€™t cover every scenario. The userâ€™s context is important, too.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


Ramsâ€™ ten principles also fail to take some possibly desirable effects into account. For example, a design may need to actually be obtrusive in order to ignite positive change. This is why I think a good understanding of the context is really important and that those ten principles might need to be ignored or changed in order to fit the context and achieve the desired result.

## Hobbies

Next to industrial design, I have some hobbies, too, of which some accidently transformed into freelancing activities: web development, graphic design and photo&shy;graphy. Additionally, I end up spending a lot of my spare time on activities by the [study association](https://svid.nl/about) of our faculty: I was in two committees and the board over the past few years. This year, Iâ€™m trying to improve our education in the [Faculty Student Council](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/ide-student-portal/organisation/faculty-student-council-fsr/), which is combined with the education committee of the study association.

In my spare time I listen to music almost constantly, read books visit museums and botanical gardens as often as possible and ride my racing bike (although that mostly happens in the summer, so I wonâ€™t win the _Tour de France_ anytime soon). Last but not least, I tend to my plants, like my basilicum which reached a height of 96 centimeters once ðŸ˜Ž.
