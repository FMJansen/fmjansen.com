Overall, my goal is to improve our planetâ€™s well-being, bit by bit. So I like to focus on sustainability and inclusion when designing interactions, services and systems.

## Floris & design
â€˜Designâ€™ is a very generic word, of course, but for me it is an activity which can go from the shaping of simple products, to improving a societal systems. Within that broad spectrum, these topics interest me: environmental sustainability and ethical production; household products and furniture; information security, AI and privacy; and branding.

From what Iâ€™ve learned, we, designers, are good at the following three broad competences.

    <p class="design-competence__skills">
      My skills: iteration, picking suitable methods, scientific research, learning from stakeholders (see empathising), and testing assumptions

## Floris & education

The basic curriculum of my **bachelor in Industrial Design Engineering** (2014-2018) involved the human, business/organisation and technology sides of design and my **master in Design for Interaction** (2018-2021) is more focussed on the human side.

I took several courses to get more in depth into circular product/service design, systemic design and lighting design. During my bachelor, I did a **minor at the University of Lapland** (Rovaniemi, northern Finland, 2017) and recently (2019) I participated in a **study trip, Flight Case**, where we worked on cases for four large Japanese companies.

> A very pleasant cooperator, well organised and a creative thinker.

## Floris & other things

Next to design, I have some hobbies, too, of which some accidently transformed into freelancing activities: web development, graphic design and photo&shy;graphy. Additionally, I end up spending a lot of my spare time on activities by the [study association](https://svid.nl/about) of our faculty: I was in two **committees and the board** over the past few years. Last year, I worked on improving our education as part of the **[Faculty Student Council](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/ide-student-portal/organisation/faculty-student-council-fsr/)**. I also volunteer at my [scouting club](https://scoutingoost1.nl/), where I manage things like the website, our IT and the finances as part of the board.

In 2020, I created [Inclusief Design](https://inclusief.design), an initiative to make the Dutch design scene more inclusive. Right now, itâ€™s mostly a collection of insights and resources.

I listen to music almost constantly, read books sometimes, visit museums and botanical gardens as often as possible and ride my racing bike once in a while (I wonâ€™t win the _Tour de France_ anytime soon, though). Last but not least, I take care of my plants, like my basilicum which reached a height of 96 centimeters at one point ðŸŒ¿ðŸ˜Ž.
