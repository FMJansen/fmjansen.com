## Showing more content with a modern look

[Room for Discussion](https://roomfordiscussion.com/) is the interview platform of the University of Amsterdam. They already had a website, but it wasn’t built for the amount of content the committee created. The brief: to build a website to account for the amount interviews they held, including the content around them, like recordings and photo albums.

## A website based on an existing branding

Based on an existing visual identity and the goal to present all interviews, guests and (previous) committee members, I built this website.

<div class="project__picture-group">

  <figure class="project__picture">
    <img class="project__image lazy" alt="Screenshot of the page showing the current committee."
      data-srcset="/static/img/rfd/members.png 1x,
        /static/img/rfd/members@2x.png 2x"
      src="/static/img/placeholder.jpg"
      data-src="/static/img/rfd/members.png">
    <figcaption class="project__caption">
      The current committee.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="project__picture">
    <img class="project__image lazy" alt="Screenshot of the bottom of a page with three event cards."
      data-srcset="/static/img/rfd/recommended.png 1x,
        /static/img/rfd/recommended.png 2x"
      src="/static/img/placeholder.jpg"
      data-src="/static/img/rfd/recommended.png">
    <figcaption class="project__caption">
      At the bottom of each page three interviews are shown, to make sure the visitor can always go somewhere.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="project__picture">
    <img class="project__image lazy" alt="Screenshot of the search page."
      data-srcset="/static/img/rfd/search.png 1x,
        /static/img/rfd/search@2x.png 2x"
      src="/static/img/placeholder.jpg"
      data-src="/static/img/rfd/search.png">
    <figcaption class="project__caption">
      Using the search functionality, multiple kinds of information had to be findable.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

## Designing and building

The brief was detailed in the wishes and requirements for content and structure, so I only had to adapt the existing style to fit this structure. Then, I worked in several stages towards a finished product, where some features, like search, were launched later than the first version.
