## Communicating events

The alumni association of my high school needed a website to communicate its events. It had a logo (kind of), but no specific visual style yet. So, they asked me to design this style and build their website, which we later extended to include news messages.

## A new style and website

I based the design on the colours and overall feel of the [high school itself](http://www.cygnusgymnasium.nl/) and built a Wordpress theme around that.

    <img class="project__image" alt="Screenshot of a desktop homepage with upcoming and past events, mostly white."

## Designing and building

This was a fairly small freelance project, where I got a detailed brief with all the requirements and wishes already worked out. I made a design with several iterations and then built a Wordpress theme.
