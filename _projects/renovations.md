## Involving residents in the design of their homes {#case}

The [City of Amsterdam](https://www.amsterdam.nl/) is trying to accelarate and improve the energy transition in collaboration with [AMS Institute](https://www.ams-institute.org/) and several educational institutions with [Energie Lab Zuidoost](https://www.energielabzuidoost.nl/). One of the projects Energie Lab Zuidoost is involved in, is the renovation of 280 apartments in Reigersbos. I looked at including residents in the renovation process of their own homes, so the end result will match with their wishes, behaviour and needs.

## Five interventions for the renovation process {#solution}

Currently, residents get a tour of a demo apartment and can find information on a website. However, this is often quite technical, making it hard to follow without a technical background or with low literacy. I designed five interventions in the renovation process, including a printed booklet showing the plans, to involve residents in the process in a way which suits them.

      One of the five interventions is a renovation guide: it explains the plans in a visual way, focusing on how the experience changes.

      The five interventions also include two sessions where residents can share their knowledge with the renovation team, a tour where people can experience the proposed solutions and a moment where the team communicates how they updated the plans.

    <figcaption class="project__caption">
      The interventions fit with the existing process. However, different stakeholders have their own specific perspectives on renovation processes. So, I made sure to find the overlap and define the roles for parties such as the municipality and housing association, next to the renovating party.

## Running a service design graduation project {#role}

This project took 25 weeks. I did research (observations, contextmapping, expert interviews), service design (formulating directions, formulating interventions, creating prototypes) and validation (testing with users, evaluations with stakeholders). Next to the municipality, I also collaborated with [Klimaatmissie Nederland](https://klimaatmissienederland.nl/), the renovating party, and [Stichting !WOON](https://www.wooninfo.nl/), an association which supports home owners and tenants in Amsterdam.

## Learnings {#learnings}

1. I’m quite confident with a certain kind of interviews, where we sit down for a fixed amount of time. Interviewing people on the street without an appointment requires a completely different approach. Fun, simple activities help to entice passerby to join, and you have to be even more sure of what your main question(s) are.
2. Recruitment can be difficult in a very specific context. I would have probably made it easier for myself by asking all my participants to recommend other people to me and recruit people even when I didn’t need them yet.
3. It’s easy to try and show that you know everything when it comes to (graduation) projects. For me, this meant I needed to keep reminding myself making mistakes really *is* valuable and that it’s fine to show uncertainty to stakeholders.
