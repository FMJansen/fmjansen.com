For the Industrial Design Engineering oriented magazine ‘[Turn The Page](https://svid.nl/turnthepage)’, I was the commissioner of layout, for a year. This meant I was focused on making sure the layout was coherent throughout the magazine and helping people realise their vision for their spreads. I also created the covers and wrote and designed several articles myself. For promotional activities, I created a website (which was later merged in to [svid.nl](https://fmjansen.nl/en/project/study-association-i-d/)) and some posters.
