## Launching a brand

The video production company [Springstof Media](https://springstofmedia.nl/) noticed a growing need for streaming video. To better communicate their skills to their target audience, they wanted to have a separate brand, based on their uniquely accessible and transparent services.

## Branding and website

Based on the target audience, value proposition and market positioning we built a brand profile. Based on this, we developed several logos as a brand direction and iterated towards the final result together with the client. In this direction, we also developed a style guide and a post card to send to Springstof Mediaâ€™s partners.

In parallel with the logo iterations, we worked out other brand elements and started working on the bilingual website. The website is built on WordPress and includes a [cost estimation calculator](https://streamingguys.nl/en/cost-estimation/).

## Client communication, branding, frontend

I asked [Fay de Grefte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fay-de-grefte-b8b960a8/) to help me with the branding and to make the post card and style guide. [Laurens Besselsen](https://bes-sel-sen.studio/) did most of the WordPress implementation and built the cost estimation calculator. The website design and styling, project management and client communication were my responsibility.
