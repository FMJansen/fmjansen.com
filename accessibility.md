# Accessibility statement

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements to improve accessibility for for things like websites. There are conformance levels (A, AA and AAA) and versions. My website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.2 level AA. This means that some parts do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

## Feedback

Please let me know if you encounter accessibility barriers:

- E-mail: [accessibility@fmjansen.nl](mailto:accessibility@fmjansen.nl)
- Mastodon: [freeradical.zone/@floris](https://freeradical.zone/@floris)

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

I expect all environments to work, but I have only tested on macOS with Firefox, Chrome and Safari, with VoiceOver.

## Technical specifications

I use HTML and CSS, which should work together with the web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer.

## Limitations and alternatives

Although I try my best, there are some known problems on this website. Please contact me if you observe an issue not listed below.

Known limitations:

1. **Footnotes**: Footnotes may have incorrect roles because I have not yet found out how to let Jekyll, my framework, do this correctly. Please let me know in what way it presents a problem to you, maybe I can patch it in an unexpected way.

## Assessment approach

I only did self-evaluation.
