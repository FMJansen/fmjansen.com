It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. personal website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

## Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

I expect all environments to work, but I have only tested on macOS with Firefox, Chrome and Safari, with VoiceOver.
